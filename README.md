> This project is a fork of [CheatingDaddy](https://github.com/sohzm/cheating-daddy) with modifications and enhancements. Thanks to [Soham](https://x.com/soham_btw) and all the open-source contributors who made this possible!

> Currently, we're working on a full code refactor and modularization. Once that's completed, we'll jump into addressing the major issues. You can find WIP issues & changelog below this document.

ü§ñ **Fast, light & open-source**‚ÄîGlass lives on your desktop, sees what you see, listens in real time, understands your context, and turns every moment into structured knowledge.

üí¨ **Proactive in meetings**‚Äîit surfaces action items, summaries, and answers the instant you need them.

ü´•Ô∏è **Truly invisible**‚Äînever shows up in screen recordings, screenshots, or your dock; no always-on capture or hidden sharing.

To have fun building with us, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UCZH5B5Hpd)!

## Instant Launch

‚ö°Ô∏è ¬†Skip the setup‚Äîlaunch instantly with our ready-to-run macOS app.  [[Download Here]](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/znid09apxiwtwvxer6oc9/Glass_latest.dmg?rlkey=gwvvyb3bizkl25frhs4k1zwds&st=37q31b4w&dl=1)

## Quick Start (Local Build)

### Prerequisites

First download & install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
If you are using Windows, you need to also install [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

Ensure you're using Node.js version 20.x.x to avoid build errors with native dependencies.

```bash
# Check your Node.js version
node --version

# If you need to install Node.js 20.x.x, we recommend using nvm:
# curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
# nvm install 20
# nvm use 20
```

### Installation

```bash
npm run setup
```

## Highlights


### Ask: get answers based on all your previous screen actions & audio

<img width="100%" alt="booking-screen" src="./public/assets/00.gif">

### Meetings: real-time meeting notes, live summaries, session records
